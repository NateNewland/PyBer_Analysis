# Purpose
We were tasked with making a program that would analyize the ride sharing data of our PyBer module. We needed to show fare rates, ridership and what types of cities PyBer Operates in; Also we needed to show visualizations of the data we gathered and improve access to underserved areas of the regions we are looking at. 

##Results\n

By reviewing the summary we can see that there are several key findings including:

*Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.
*Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities.
*Suburban cities have 6x + drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.
*Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.
*The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides.

### Summary
Based on the Data I gathered My reccomendations for PyBer are the following:
-increase the number of drivers in the rural areas to meet demand.
-The data for rurual cities show average fare cost in rural towns are higher than suburban, meaning the trips they are taking take longer and mean not as many riders have a chance for their trip. This increases loses at peak times.
